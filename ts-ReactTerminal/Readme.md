# ReactTerminal

Similar to [ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink).

I wanted to make it for myself to learn how CSS and React work, by implementing a host myself. 

So after a bit of fiddling remaking React seems like a bad idea. 
Specifically, the interactivity part.
Making a equivalent to `renderToStaticMarkup` is still nice and complicated I think.
