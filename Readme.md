# MonoTypeScript

A collection of all my TypeScript projects under one repository. 

## FAQ

#### Why use a monorepo setup?

As changes often cover multiple projects, recreating the exact state of libraries used in a older version is too hard.

#### Why prefix everything with `ts-`?

I use a number of different languages, and sometimes I implement the same program using multiple languages.
By using a language prefix it is easier to keep track of which project is which in the recent folder menu. 

#### Why infix `-node-`? `-site-`?

When building in alphabetical order, every project will have its depencies built before itself.
