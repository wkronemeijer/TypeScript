# MonoTypeScript

A collection of all my TypeScript projects under one repository. 
Almost all of them make use of `ts-System`, which why this is a monorepo.

I use a number of different languages, and sometimes I implement the same program using multiple languages.
By using a language prefix (like `ts-`) it is easier to keep track of which is which in a recent folder menu.
