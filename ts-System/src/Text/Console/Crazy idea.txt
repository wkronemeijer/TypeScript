What if instead of unset sequences, a marker is placed, that is resolved at the top level. This top level replaces those markers with things which "pop" the state. 

Example:

\[Red]This some neat \[Cyan]text\[pop!], don't you think?\[reset]

would produce the following string:
ESC[31mThis is some neat ESC[35mtextESC[31m, don't you think?ESC[0m

Downside: not arbitrary strings for other outputs
Upside: proper pushing and popping color, no need to keep track of previous color externally. No problems with nesting text decorations.
